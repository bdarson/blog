I can make you pretty cool websites, if I do say so myself.

                <br>
            Might as well journal my intentions here a bit I guess. So these drawers to either side are supposed to contain, from top to bottom and left to right, the site navigation, a search bar for this blog, a login function (for comments or something? Might be fun), and an info section for the overall page.
                <br>
                <br>
            If I keep this style for pages for individual posts, maybe the about board can also be for extra information about the post, unnecessary or supplemental information. something to play with.
        </div>

    <!--Move the content to the left once all of the drawers are to the right. Might happen automatically.-->
    
    <!--VERBAL SKETCH: Move all drawers to either the right or left, then flatten the borders to the opposite side on the posts/content and press them against that side of the screen. Kills some white space and gives posts a bit more room.
    
    Leaves the question; What to prioritize access to, menus or content? Probably menus, Put those to the right and posts to the left.

    Look into using javascript to flip them for left-handers.-->

                So Mother's Day is coming up, and with my particular skillset that means it's time to make my wife some gift art. I'm VERY proud of how it came out, so I thought I'd go ahead and post it here. I put it over to the left there as the thumbnail, and I'll have it larger in the full post below! [...]

                Feeling pretty good about my progress so far, I'm touching up a lot of my old pages, building better habits, using LinkedIn more (if you're here from there, welcome! I'm improving the site I promise), and I generally feel like I'm on the right track. [...]

                So Right now I'm writing these posts manually. This text isn't even in &lt;p&gt; tags - I'm just sending it out fresh I guess! That's probably a mistake. One I can fix later, though!

                I'm Brandon Watson and at the time of writing, this site is very inprogress! I'll put a screenshot in here later for posterity, because this site will DEFINITELY have undergone some upgrades since this first post. Maybe it's 2030 when you're reading this, my kid is 10, his school is going great, and I've been working for you for 5, 6 years now! Sounds pretty good to me.

            I can even see what happens if I try to put a line break within a div - of course, that's a gimme, and the line above this paragraph should just be a lil break in the text, but I am a lowly human programmer and I am, myself, imperfect, and I have rewritten this silly placeholder stuff at least three times. Working on it though!

            This is looking a bit wide... I should put a picture to the left or right to add some more visual interest to the page, and narrow down this text field. I'll set a default image in case I just ain't feelin' it, but it might be a fun exercise to make a doodle for every post. Maybe even a quick reference of every image in the post to the left, below the main focus image? Hey who knows.
