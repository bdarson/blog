            I'd really like to learn the ins and outs of generating this kind of stuff myself. Like, make a publishing page, so I can type in the content that I want and then publish it like that as if it was wordpress or similar, except I control the backend too.
                <br>
                <br>
            Long term, I'd really like to master this as a whole. I want to be able to make a forum, a blog platform, all that kinda stuff, and to do that I need to get better with PHP. Maybe that should be my next priority step as far as the self-education goes, and then as that's happening I should improve my javascript alongside it.
                <br>
                <br>
            Now if only I could do something like that to improve my design sense. I don't think any of this looks bad but I don't think I'd be blown over by it if I found it in the wild. I'm proud of it but it feels... basic. Gotta figure it out.

            <div class="ppr-body">This post is a testing ground. It is where bad code goes to die. If there is a problem in the code that is displaying this post, I shall find it, and I shall crush it. I will not fear the cringe of my placeholder stuff, because no one is even supposed to see this. Whatever man.

                I can even see what happens if I try to put a line break within a div - of course, that's a gimme, and the line above this paragraph should just be a lil break in the text, but I am a lowly human programmer and I am, myself, imperfect, and I have rewritten this silly placeholder stuff at least three times. Working on it though!

                This is looking a bit wide... I should put a picture to the left or right to add some more visual interest to the page, and narrow down this text field. I'll set a default image in case I just ain't feelin' it, but it might be a fun exercise to make a doodle for every post. Maybe even a quick reference of every image in the post to the left, below the main focus image? Hey who knows.

                This IS supposed to be a preview of a full post, though. Let's just put some dots down and [...]
