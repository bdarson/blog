            <p class="abt-text">First real post for this site! I'll probably leave the test post up for fun but this'll be the first one I'm taking seriously as a piece of writing. You can tell I'm taking it seriously because I'm listening to Radiohead while writing it, and I went back and forth like three times between whether I should just say Radiohead or specify that I'm listening to the album Kid A. That's serious consideration there.
                <br>
                <br>
            But in all seriousness, thank you for taking the time to read this. I'm working hard on this site - this blog page especially - and I want to do well and impress. I want to build things by hand, I want to be helpful and useful, and I want to meet people who think like that, who think that the internet is a powerful tool for humanity that needs to be focused a bit better than it is right now to actually be of use to people. If you're on the same page, drop me a line on the Contact button. There's one on the main site, and soon enough I should have one in the bottom right corner of the blog too.
                <br>
                <br>
            This side section is essentially a free-for-all. If I have extra thoughts that are tangents, or maybe something entirely unrelated I'm thinking about, or just something that happened to me on the day of writing, it'll go here. I tend to get distracted, and having a place on the page to put those asides will be helpful for me - it already has been in writing this one!

                <br>
            I played through the Kid A Mnesiac game on my PS5 between writing this. That's actually why I'm listening to Kid A tonight; I'm actually not that huge of a Radiohead fan, haven't really given them a shot but I liked that thing a lot. Figured I should listen to the album after playing the artsy game designed around knowing it lol.

                I'm Brandon Watson and at the time of writing, this site is very inprogress! I'll put a screenshot in here later for posterity, because this site will DEFINITELY have undergone some upgrades since this first post. Maybe it's 2030 when you're reading this, my kid is 10, his school is going great, and I've been working for you for 5, 6 years now! Sounds pretty good to me.
            <br>
            <br>
                Anyway, I'm gonna put the cut here on the preview and put that screenshot down and get to some serious talking.

                Welcome back! Here's what this site looked like in 2024.

                It's 4:30AM on March 25th 2024, and I'm working hard to follow my passions. I'm putting my all into making these sites, and I can only hope it's gonna pay off soon. I need to put myself out there more,I know, and I think I've been doing that in little ways, but I'm thinking that making a blog like this might be a big way.
            <br><br>
                I mean, it FEELS big at least; I've never really done public journaling like this before. If I'm going to get a job doing what I love, I need to get used to it. Stop feeling like I'm sabotaging myself by being myself. Been feeling like that too long.
            <br><br>
                Anyway, that's enough late-night oversharing. Thanks for reading, whoever you might be.
