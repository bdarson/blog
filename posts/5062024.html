                    So Mother's Day is coming up, and with my particular skillset that means it's time to make my wife some gift art. I'm VERY proud of how it came out, so I thought I'd go ahead and post it here. I put it over to the left there as the thumbnail, and I'll have it larger in the full post below!
                <br><br>

                    The piece was created entirely in Clip Studio Paint, from sketch to completion. I started from a photo of my wife and son, used it as reference, and proceeded to refine the shapes and color from there.
                <br><br>
                    The shading was separated into separate layers for hard and soft shadows at 15% and 70% opacity respectively. I used the hard shadow layer to also add pseudo-outlines to points of separation to make the difference between similar areas more distinct, and to add a bit of stylization to a simple idea.
                <br><br>
                    I hope you like the piece, and I also hope my wife does. I'll be posting pieces like this on LinkedIn, which I should probably also link on my home page! More on the todo pile.
