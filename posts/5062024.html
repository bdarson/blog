                Not a lot to say on this one just yet, probably going to leave this text as a placeholder until then. Can't hurt to generally put some thoughts down, though!

                This is the first post I'm making with a slightly better-looking header. If you're reading this, you probably have little to no idea what I mean, but I'm really happy with the progress all of my sites are making. Now I just need a gig or two, or a steady job, to get my career rolling properly!

                    So Mother's Day is coming up, and with my particular skillset that means it's time to make my wife some gift art. I'm VERY proud of how it came out, so I thought I'd go ahead and post it here. I put it over to the left there as the thumbnail, and I'll have it larger in the full post below!

                    The piece was created entirely in Clip Studio Paint, from sketch to completion. I started from a photo of my wife and son, used it as reference, and proceeded to refine the shapes and color from there.
                <br><br>
                    The shading was separated into separate layers for hard and soft shadows at 15% and 70% opacity respectively. I used the hard shadow layer to also add pseudo-outlines to points of separation to make the difference between similar areas more distinct, and to add a bit of stylization to a simple idea.
                <br><br>
                    I hope you like the piece, and I also hope my wife does. I'll be posting pieces like this on LinkedIn, which I should probably also link on my home page! More on the todo pile.
